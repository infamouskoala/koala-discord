# KOALA
- This is a discord bot that is coded in python. I use it in my [discord server](https://discord.gg/5b8pyv99j2), the code is open source as I wanna keep this as a side project. Feel free to pull any merge requests with commands that u think i should add in the bot. You can also use this script with your own **__private__** bots

- If you decide to host a public bot using my script, kindly mention the use of the code snippets that you might be taking from it.
